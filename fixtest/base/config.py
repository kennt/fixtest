""" Configuration support

    Configuration here refers to a description of how the system and
    its connections are setup.

    There are two main components, the first one are the individual
    agents (or nodes) in the system.  The second are the connections
    (network links) in the system.

    We do not directly refer to the nodes in the sytem, but instead
    refer to them by the "roles" they play within the system.  These
    roles can be: "server", "client", "gateway", etc...  The node
    configurations provide information on these components.

    The link configurations describe the network configuration between
    two nodes.  Thus there is always a machine that acts as a receiver
    (e.g. the Server) and a machine that acts as a sender (the Client).
    Note that a machine with a certain role, say "Gateway" may act as
    a Client and a Server depending on the link confiugration.

    Additional sections may be added as needed.

    Each configuration object is a normal Python dict().  However, they
    can be sourced from anywhere.
